# Directed Acyclic Graphs

- A *confounder* is a variable that simultaneously affects the treatment indicator and the outcome (the same as an omitted variable).
- A *collider* is a variable that is simultaneously affected by the treatment indicator and the outcome.
- A *backdoor path* is a path from the treatment indicator to the outcome via a confounder.
- There are two ways to close a backdoor path:
  - Control for the confounder if it is available
  - Have a collider on the backdoor path
- An analysis design meets the *backdoor criterion* if all backdoor paths are closed, in which case we have isolated a causal effect.
