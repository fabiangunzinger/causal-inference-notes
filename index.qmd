# Welcome

The aim of thia book is to collect all I know about online experiments. I do this mainly for personal reference because I forget stuff. But if you find the notes helpful, find any errors, or have any suggestions, please get in touch by writing to <fa.gunzinger@gmail.com>.

My aim is to capture the material I need as concisely as I can. There are many excellent resources out there that explain concepts more elaborately (e.g.
[here](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html), [here](https://alexdeng.github.io/causal/re)).
