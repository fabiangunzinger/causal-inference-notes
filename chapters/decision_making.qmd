- How should you set the significance level, power, and the MDE?

How do you decide whetehr to launch of not?

- Decide in advance: have amber, red, green system for different possible cases (see Kohavi possibilities with 0 and MDE graphs)

- If result is no-go
  - Deep dives to understand where the problem was
  - As basis for iterating on the idea
