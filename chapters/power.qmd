# Power

## What is Power

## What determines power

- Significance level

- Sample size

- Effect size

- Metric variance


## How to increase power

- Power can be increased trivially by lowering the significance level, which we often don't want to do, or by increasing sample size, which we're often trying to avoid.

- Increase effect size

    - Ensure that only users who are exposed to the change are in the data to avoid dilution of the effect

- Reduce metric variance

    - 



## Reasons for insufficient power

Notes from @larsen2023statistical

- Reasons for insufficient power
    - Treatment effect is homogenously distributed across entire user base but very small

    - Feature affects only small number of users, so overall effect is highly attenuated

    - Treatment effect on known subgroups is of interest

## Calculating power

- See @zhou2023all for comprehensive overview

- See @bojinov2023design, section 5, for simulation results for switchbacks and generally good approach to simulation to emulate


## Cluster-randomised experiments

See @reich2012empirical
