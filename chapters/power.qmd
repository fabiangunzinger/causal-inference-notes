# Power

## What is Power

## Reasons for insufficient power

Notes from @larsen2023statistical

- Reasons for insufficient power
    - Treatment effect is homogenously distributed across entire user base but very small
    - Feature affects only small number of users, so overall effect is highly attenuated
    - Treatment effect on known subgroups is of interest

## Calculating power

See @zhou2023all


## Cluster-randomised experiments

See @reich2012empirical
