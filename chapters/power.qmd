# Power

Notes from larsen2023statistical

- Reasons for insufficient power
    - Treatment effect is homogenously distributed across entire user base but very small
    - Feature affects only small number of users, so overall effect is highly attenuated
    - Treatment effect on known subgroups is of interest
