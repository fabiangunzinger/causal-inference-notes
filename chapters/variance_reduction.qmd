# Variance reduction

## Why reduce variance?

TODO:
- Explain that we wanna increase power (refer to power section)
- Reducing variance is one way to increase power (often the only feasible one)

The estimand of interest is the population average treatment effect:

$$
\tau = \bar{y}_t - \bar{y}_c.
$$

Under random treatment assignment, an unbiased estimator of $\tau$ is the difference in means between treatment and control units in the sample:

$$
\hat{\tau}^{dif} = \bar{y}_t^{obs} - \bar{y}_c^{obs}.
$$

The variance of $\hat{\tau}^{dif}$ is given by:

$$
\mathbb{V}(\hat{\tau}^{dif}) = \frac{s_t}{N_t} + \frac{s_c}{N_c},
$$

where

$$
s_t = \frac{1}{N_t - 1}\sum_{\text{i:d=1}}(y_i - \bar{y}_t^{obs})^2, \quad s_c = \frac{1}{N_c - 1}\sum_{\text{i:d=0}}(y_i - \bar{y}_c^{obs})^2.
$$

Hence: for a given sample size, we can reduce $\mathbb{V}(\hat{\tau}^{dif})$ by reducing the variance in the outcome metric, $Y$ -- this is the variance we are trying to reduce.

## What about the variance-bias trade-off?

Discuss why we can reduce variance without increasing bias.

## Regression adjustment

Regression adjustment reduces variance by adding additional regressors to the regression model used to evaluate an experiment in order to reduce residual variance.

**How it works**

To evaluate an experiment where we have, for each unit $i$, an outcome metric $y_i$ and a treatment assignment indicator $d_i$ we would estimate the following linear regression model using OLS:

$$
y_i = \alpha + \beta d_i + \epsilon_i,
$$

where $\epsilon_i$ is the error term, and where the estimate of $\beta$ is the estimate of our average treatment effect. If we have an additional variable, $x_i$, that is correlated with $y_i$ but uncorrelated with $d_i$, we can add that to the right hand side of our regression model and estimate:

$$
\begin{equation}
y_i = \alpha + \beta_1 d_i + \beta_2 x_i + \mu_i.
\end{equation}
$$

If $x$ is uncorrelated with the treatment assignment then $\beta = \beta_1$, so the average treatment effect estimate will remain unchanged, which is good. And if $x$ is correlated with $y$, then the standard error of the average treatment effect estimate will again be lower, which increases power.
