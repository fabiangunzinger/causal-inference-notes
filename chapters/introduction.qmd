# Introduction


## Why causal inference?

- Because many thinks we think work don't (look at list of refuted claims from Kohavi [here](https://experimentguide.com/refuted_observational_studies/))

The purpose:

- Create a valid counterfactual outcome - the outcome of the treated if they had not been treated - in order to eliminate selection bias when estimating the treatment effect.


## Why experiments

1. The randomisation of treatment eliminates selection bias.

2. The presence of a control group provides a counterfactual of what would have happened without treatment.

## Fundamental problem of causal inference


## Thinking about causality


- [Milton Friedman thermostat example](https://www.mercatus.org/macro-musings/nick-rowe-monetary-basics-milton-friedmans-thermostat-and-more)

## Interpretation

- We often think of experiment as answering: "Does the intervention work?", but what it really answers is "What is the average effect of the intervention with this specific implementation for this particular population at this time?"

- When we have multiple treatments or analyse subgroups separately, we need to test whether different estimates are significantly different from each other (can't just look at whether some are significantly different from zero while some aren't) 


## Conventions used throughout

- I use users instead of the more generic units

- I discuss the case with one treatment and one control group.
