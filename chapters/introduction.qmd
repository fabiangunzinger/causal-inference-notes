# Introduction


## Why causal inference?

- Because many thinks we think work don't (look at list of refuted claims from Kohavi [here](https://experimentguide.com/refuted_observational_studies/))

The purpose:

- Create a valid counterfactual outcome - the outcome of the treated if they had not been treated - in order to eliminate selection bias when estimating the treatment effect.


## Why experiments

1. The randomisation of treatment eliminates selection bias.

2. The presence of a control group provides a counterfactual of what would have happened without treatment.


## Limitations of experiments

Look at Deaton and Cartwright papers.

1) They cannot be used to study the past.

2) They can only estimate the effect of treatments that can be manipulated ("no causation without manipulation" Rubin). 

3) Guidance for policy limited by compliance issues, environmental dependence, and equilibrium effects.

4) There are ethical concerns.
