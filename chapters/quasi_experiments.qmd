- At design stage:

  - Re-randomise until they have decent balance on observables

- At analysis stage:

  - Diff-in-diffs with multiple interventions and other advanced techniques



## QE at Booking.com 

- [Booking.com -- Thereâ€™s more to experimentation than A/B](https://booking.ai/theres-more-to-experimentation-than-a-b-223fba846876)
  
- Describes Bayesian structural time-series model


## Limits of quasi-experiments

- @kohavi2020trustworthy in sidebar on p. 147 cite a number of great studies that comper obervational causal studies to experiments and generally find that the former perform poorly.

- There is also a useful list [here](https://experimentguide.com/refuted_observational_studies/)


## How to decide when to use QEs in practice?

- @bojinov2020importance have a useful decision tree: is the question of interest descriptive, predictive, or causal in nature? If causal, can you run an experiment? If not, use a QE approach.


## QE methods overview tabls

- [This](https://medium.com/data-shopify/how-to-use-quasi-experiments-and-counterfactuals-to-build-great-products-487193794da) post provides a useful categorisation of methods:

    - Experiments (control exists and treatment randomly assigned)

    - Quasi-experimental methods (contorl exists but treatment not random)

    - Counterfactuals (control doesn't exist -- e.g. synthethic diff-in-diffs, Causalimpact)
