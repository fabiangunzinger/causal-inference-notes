# Neyman-Rubin causal model


## Potential outcomes

## Causal estimands

- We have a population of units $i = 1, \dots, N$.

- Each unit in the population can be exposed to one of two treatments, which are identical across units, so that $\mathbb{T}_i = \mathbb{T} = \{0, 1\}$.

- Each unit $i$ has potential outcomes $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$ corresponding to each of the two possible treatments.

- Unit-level causal effects are given by comparisons of $Y_i(0)$ and $Y_i(1)$, often expressed as a simple difference:

$$
Y_i(1) - Y_i(0).
$$

- We often want to summarise unit-level treatment effects, to which effect we can calculate many different causal estimands.

- The average treatment effect over the entire population (the finite sample) is defined as:

$$
\tau_{fs} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \left(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\right).
$$

- We can generalise this in a number of ways.

- We can focus only on a subset of the population, which can also happen in different ways.

- We can condition on covariates, such as when we focus only on women:
$$
\tau_{fs, f} = \frac{1}{N_f}\sum_{i: X_i = f} \left(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\right), \quad \text{where $X_i = \{m , f\}$ and $N_f = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{1}_{X_i = f}$}
$$

- We can condition on treatment status, such as when we focus only on units that were exposed to the treatment: 

$$
\tau_{fs, t} = \frac{1}{N_t}\sum_{i: W_i = 1} \left(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\right), \quad \text{where $W_i = \{0 , 1\}$ and $N_t = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{1}_{W_i = 1}$}
$$

- We can condition on potential outcomes, such as when we focus only on units with positive potential outcomes (e.g. positive earnings) regardless of treatment status:

$$
\tau_{fs, pos} = \frac{1}{N_{pos}}\sum_{i: Y_i(0)>0, Y_i(1)>0} \left(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)\right), \quad \text{where $N_{post} = \sum_{i=1}^N \mathbb{1}_{Y_i(0)>0, Y_i(1)>0}$}
$$

- We can also generalise the estimand by focusing on more general functions of the potential outcomes (e.g. we may focus on the median outcome of the entire population or a subpopulation).

- In all these cases, we can write the causal estimand as a row-exchangeable function (a function that takes vectors or matrices as arguments and the result of which does not change if the rows in its input are permuted):

$$
\tau = \tau(Y(0), Y(1), X, W)
$$
