# Small samples

- Small samples can be a problem because they lower our statistical power

- For a given significance level and power, we can increase power by
  - Increasing the sample size
  - Change the effect size
  - Reduce outcome metric variance

- Increasing the sample size is precisely what we sometimes cannot do, so let's focus on the other two.

Approaches to change effect size

- Choose outcome metrics that can be moved

- Make treatment stronger (if possible)

Reduce outcome metric variance

- Reduce noise by using variance reduction technique (see separate note)
  
- Reduce noise by averaging observations over time (see beyond baseline paper)

- Reduce noise by making sample as homogeous as possible

    - Drop outliers

    - Drop cluster that is very different in size from others

- Reduce noise by ensuring balance ex-ante (e.g. matching)
