# Important topics

This is a placeholder to copy important concepts for AB testing in practice that I want to cover somewhere.

Test yourself. How many of Nils Stotz essential statistical concepts do you understand well?

Several important concepts not mentioned, which are covered in my course, https://bit.ly/ABClassRKLI:
- Statistical power (low power leads to high false positive risk and exaggeration of effects)
- Twyman's law (other people also suggested; my summary at https://bit.ly/twymanLaw) 
- Triggering (improve the efficiency by removing unimpacted populations)
- Leakage/interference (when assumptions are violated).

Statistical Concepts are Essential to Experimentation. Here's a Summary of the Top 9 in One Sentence Each ❤️💡

🧮 Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)
A discrepancy in sample sizes across test groups, potentially leading to biased outcomes.

🔄 Simpson’s Paradox
A phenomenon where a trend appears in several different groups of data but disappears or reverses when these groups are combined.

🏆 Overall Evaluation Criteria (OEC)
Criteria that define the measures used to assess the success or failure of an experiment.

🎯 Goodhart’s Law
When a measure becomes a target, it can no longer be used as a reliable indicator.

🔍 Heterogeneous Treatment Effects
Variability in treatment effects among participants in different subgroups of an experiment.

📉 Signal Noise Ratio
The measure of signal (meaningful data) to noise (random data) in experimental results.

🛑 P-hacking
The practice of repeatedly trying different statistics or data configurations until significant results are obtained.

🔁 Regression to the Mean
The phenomenon where extreme observations tend to return to their average on additional testing.

🧐 Multiple Comparison Problem
The increased chance of erroneous inferences from making multiple statistical comparisons.
