# Practical issues

There are a lot of things that can make life hard for online experimenters.


## Budget effects in Ads

## Feedback loops from personalisation

## Cannibalisation and crossover

##Â Seasonality

- Seasonality comes in many forms: day of week effects, week of year effects, season effects, holiday effects, etc.

- The challenge is that, potentially, user behaviour might differ on certain days or over certain time periods. Whether it is really a problem depends on the context. One aspect that is often forgotten here is that seasonality, first and foremost, is about a shift in levels -- activity on LinkedIn might go down during the summer months. What we usually want to measure, however, is the difference between treatment and control units. Hence, if you don't have reason to believe that the effect of the treatment is different during a particular season (e.g. because you think it's additive), then seasonality might not be a problem for you.

- Solution: design your experiment so as to take seasonality into account. E.g. run your experiment for at least one week to account for day of week effects (that's generally a good idea), don't run crucial experiments during the holiday season or on major holidays or discard data from such periods, etc. 

- What to take into account depends on your context. So understand the relevant seasonality for you (if you're a travel app, consider seasonality of travel demand, if you're an e-commerce site, consider seasonality of shopping behaviour)


## Novelty and learning effects

Challenge: behaviour might change abruptly and temporarily in response to a new feature (novelty effect) or it might take a while for behaviour fully adapt to a new feature (learning effects). In both cases, the results from a relatively short experiment will not provide a representative picture of the long-run effects of a feature.

Solution: measure long-term effects (by running experiments for longer) or, at least, estimate dynamic treatment effects to see the evolution of the treatment effect.
