# Network experiments

- Network experiments are experiments where there the treatment status of units might determine the outcome of other units, thus violating the [SUTVA assumption](neyman_rubin_causal_model.qmd## Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)
)

- Ways to measure the strength of interaction effects

    - Overall approach: if there are no interaction effects, different estimands should be the same

    - Design side: run clauster and unit-level experiment side-by-side. Different results imply presence of interaction effects

    - Analysis side: 1) exposure modelling / reweighting 2) use of focal units

- Ways to deal with interaction effects:

    - Randomise at the level at which general-equilibrium effects play out. There are two challenges with this:

        - Finding the appropriate level at which to randomise/cluster: effectively, you need to find the clusters between which there is no interactions, so that externalities don't spill across cluster boundaries. Examples:

            - Geographical clustering:
  
              - to experiment on currier behaviour in a food delivery network: randomise at a level at which curriers don't interact (such as a part of a large city, or even between cities).

              - In a online-dating network, clusters may be geographical regions between which there is little interaction between users (i.e. locations to far away for people to wanting to find partners)

            - social/interaction-graph-clustering:

              - To test a feature in a social-network app: create graphs of user interactions, and partition the graph such that there is maximal within-group interaction and minimal between group interaction



        - Ensuring you have enough effective sample size: if the outcomes of users within a group are correlated, then randomising at a level higher than the unit reduces effective sample size. In the extreme case, where within group correlation is perfect, your effective sample size is the number of groups, not the number of units.



    - Can also measure network effects by administring different levels of the treatment (Duflo paper)
