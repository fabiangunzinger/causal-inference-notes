# Practical issues

There are a lot of things that can make life hard for online experimenters.


## Budget effects in Ads

## Feedback loops from personalisation

## Cannibalisation and crossover

## Day of week effects

Challenge: User behaviour might differ on different days of the week (weekend vs weekday, Mondays vs Fridays, etc.).

Solution: Run your experiment for at least one week.


## Holidays

Challenge: User behaviour might be systematically different during public holidays.

Solution: discard data from these days / don't run A/B tests during holiday periods.

## Novelty and learning effects

Challenge: behaviour might change abruptly and temporarily in response to a new feature (novelty effect) or it might take a while for behaviour fully adapt to a new feature (learning effects). In both cases, the results from a relatively short experiment will not provide a representative picture of the long-run effects of a feature.

Solution: measure long-term effects (by running experiments for longer) or, at least, estimate dynamic treatment effects to see the evolution of the treatment effect.
