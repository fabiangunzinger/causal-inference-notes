Above, we defined \\(p\\) as \\(p = ax\\), where \\(a\\) was the scalar that characterised the line and \\(x\\) the scalar that helped us move along that line. Similarly, we now have \\(p = Ax\\), where \\(A\\) is a 2 x 2 matrix, the two columns of which are the base vectors of the 2-dimensional subspace.\nWe can still go about finding \\(p\\) in the same way as above:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nargmin_{x} (b - Ax)'(b - Ax) \\\\\n\\frac{d}{dx} (b - Ax)'(b - Ax) &= -2A'(b - Ax) = 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSolving for \\(x\\) we get: \\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n-2A'(b - Ax) &= 0 \\\\\n-A'b + A'Ax &= 0 \\\\\nA'Ax &= A'b \\\\\nx &= (A'A)^{-1}A'b\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThe last step above works only if \\(A'A\\) is actually invertible, which is the case if \\(A\\) has full rank, which is the case if none of its columns can be constructed from a linear combination of any other columns. (A visual way to think about this is the following: the columns of a matrix are the basis vectors of its column space. The rank is the number of dimensions of that column space. Full rank means that the column space has as many dimensions as there are columns.)\nThe math above generalises directly to projections onto N-dimensional space. All that changes is that \\(b\\), \\(A\\), \\(x\\), and \\(p\\) are higher-dimensional objects, and that visualising what’s happening becomes rather mind-bending."

If we didn’t make these assumptions, the factor by which CUPED reduces variance would be a more complicated term than \\(\\left(1 - \\rho^2\\right)\\), involving separte variances and covariances from the treatment and control groups."

Identical to regression only in simple case (show FWL link – have separate post on understanding FWL with relevant regression examples)\n\nTake inclusion of constant into accound (centering variables, but doesn’t change correlations)\n\nIt turns out that in the simple cases discussed above, it doesn’t – the two approaches are identical! Seeing why requires a few steps.\nFirst, we know (from the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem) that if we were to estimate the alternative model\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tilde{y}_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1^* \\tilde{d}_i + \\epsilon_i,\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde{y}_i\\) is the residual from regressing \\(y\\) on \\(x\\), and \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\) the residual from regressing \\(d\\) on \\(x\\), we would find that \\(\\beta_1^* = \\beta_1\\). That is, the two models are identical.\nSecond, to obtain \\(\\tilde{y}\\), we first estimate\n\\[\ny = \\alpha + \\delta x_i + u_i,\n\\]\nand then calculate \\(\\tilde{y} = y - \\delta x\\) (the calculation of \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\) works analogously). Given that this is a simple regression model, we know that \\(\\delta = \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)}\\) so that\n\\[\n\\tilde{y} = y - \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)}x.\n\\]\nFinally, above in our discussion of CUPED we have seen that the CUPED-adjusted outcome metric \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is defined in exactly the same way. Hence, to evaluate an experiment with a CUPED-adjusted outcome, we would estimate the model:\n\\[\n\\tilde{y}_i = \\alpha + \\beta^* d_i + \\epsilon_i^*,\n\\]\nNotice that the only difference to model (2) is that we don’t adjust the treatment assignment – we use \\(d_i\\) instead of \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\). But if the treatment assignment is random, then \\(cov(d, x) = 0\\) so that the adjustment has no effect and we have \\(\\tilde{d}_i = d_i\\). Hence, the two approaches are the same.\nIn general, regression adjustment and CUPED are identical if two conditions hold: (1) the treatment indicator is independent of \\(x\\), and (2) we use a linear CUPED adjustment. In the context of experimentation, where treatment is random, and with the classical (linear) CUPED adjustment discussed above, this is always the case.\nThe reason why in practice we get a don’t get the exact same result is that the covariance of \\(d\\) and \\(x\\) is only approximately 0, hence providing very similar, but not identical results."

To be precise, we have:\n\\[\nvar(\\tilde{y}) = var(y)(1 - \\rho^2),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the Pearson correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)var(y)}.\n\\]\n\\(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\) is unbiased:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\right] &= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_t - \\bar{Y}^{cuped}_c\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t + \\theta \\mathbb{E}X\\right) - \\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c + \\theta \\mathbb{E}X\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t\\right) - \\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{Y}_t - \\bar{Y}_c\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N_t}\\sum_{\\text{i:T=1}}Y_i- \\frac{1}{N_c}\\sum_{\\text{i:T=0}}Y_i\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{N_t} N_t \\mathbb{E}Y_t - \\frac{1}{N_c} N_c \\mathbb{E}Y_c \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}Y_t - \\mathbb{E}Y_c \\\\\n&= \\bar{Y}_t - \\bar{Y}_c \\\\\n&= \\tau\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\\(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\) has variance:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{V}\\left(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\right) &= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_t - \\bar{Y}^{cuped}_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_t\\right) + \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t + \\theta \\mathbb{E}X\\right) + \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c + \\theta\n\\mathbb{E}X\\right) \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t\\right) + \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{N_t}\\mathbb{V}\\left(Y_t - \\theta X_t\\right) + \\frac{1}{N_c}\\mathbb{V}\\left(Y_c - \\theta X_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{N_t}\\left[\\mathbb{V}(Y_t) + \\theta^2 \\mathbb{V}(X_t) - 2\\theta Cov(Y_t, X_t)\\right] + \\frac{1}{N_c}\\left[\\mathbb{V}(Y_c) + \\theta^2 \\mathbb{V}(X_c) - 2\\theta Cov(Y_c, X_c)\\right]\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThis is minimised for:\n\\[\n\\theta^* = \\frac{Cov(Y_t, X_t) + Cov(Y_c, X_c)}{\\mathbb{V}(X_t) + \\mathbb{V}(X_c)}\n\\]\nIn practice, a common approach is to pool the data to get:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\theta^*_p &= \\frac{Cov(Y, X) + Cov(Y, X)}{\\mathbb{V}(X) + \\mathbb{V}(X)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{Cov(Y, X)}{\\mathbb{V}(X)},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nand to assume that \\(\\mathbb{V}(X_t) \\simeq \\mathbb{V}(X_t)\\), and \\(Cov(Y_t, X_t) \\simeq Cov(Y_c, X_c)\\), which is reasonable as long as the treatment effect is not too large (see discussion towards the end here).

If we didn’t make these assumptions, the factor by which CUPED reduces variance would be a more complicated term than \\(\\left(1 - \\rho^2\\right)\\), involving separte variances and covariances from the treatment and control groups.\n\n\n\n4.2.2 Features of CUPED\n\nAlso permits non-linear adjustments (i.e. not reliant on linearity assumptions in OLS)\n\n\n\n4.2.3 Is CUPED regression adjustment?\ntodo: - Is CUPED regression adjustment? Identical to regression only in simple case (show FWL link – have separate post on understanding FWL with relevant regression examples)\n\nTake inclusion of constant into accound (centering variables, but doesn’t change correlations)\n\nIt turns out that in the simple cases discussed above, it doesn’t – the two approaches are identical! Seeing why requires a few steps.\nFirst, we know (from the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem) that if we were to estimate the alternative model\n\\[\n\\begin{equation}\n\\tilde{y}_i = \\alpha + \\beta_1^* \\tilde{d}_i + \\epsilon_i,\n\\end{equation}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\tilde{y}_i\\) is the residual from regressing \\(y\\) on \\(x\\), and \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\) the residual from regressing \\(d\\) on \\(x\\), we would find that \\(\\beta_1^* = \\beta_1\\). That is, the two models are identical.\nSecond, to obtain \\(\\tilde{y}\\), we first estimate\n\\[\ny = \\alpha + \\delta x_i + u_i,\n\\]\nand then calculate \\(\\tilde{y} = y - \\delta x\\) (the calculation of \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\) works analogously). Given that this is a simple regression model, we know that \\(\\delta = \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)}\\) so that\n\\[\n\\tilde{y} = y - \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)}x.\n\\]\nFinally, above in our discussion of CUPED we have seen that the CUPED-adjusted outcome metric \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is defined in exactly the same way. Hence, to evaluate an experiment with a CUPED-adjusted outcome, we would estimate the model:\n\\[\n\\tilde{y}_i = \\alpha + \\beta^* d_i + \\epsilon_i^*,\n\\]\nNotice that the only difference to model (2) is that we don’t adjust the treatment assignment – we use \\(d_i\\) instead of \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\). But if the treatment assignment is random, then \\(cov(d, x) = 0\\) so that the adjustment has no effect and we have \\(\\tilde{d}_i = d_i\\). Hence, the two approaches are the same.\nIn general, regression adjustment and CUPED are identical if two conditions hold: (1) the treatment indicator is independent of \\(x\\), and (2) we use a linear CUPED adjustment. In the context of experimentation, where treatment is random, and with the classical (linear) CUPED adjustment discussed above, this is always the case.\nThe reason why in practice we get a don’t get the exact same result is that the covariance of \\(d\\) and \\(x\\) is only approximately 0, hence providing very similar, but not identical results.\n\n\n4.2.4 Is CUPED DiD?\n\nIs CUPED DiD?

Pre-experiment data of the outcome metric is a good candidate for \\(x\\) when it is available – it’s what’s commonly used, and where the method gets its name from. With that in hand, notice that we can write\n– the most obvious candidate that has been found to work well is pre-experiment data of the metric of interest.\nWe can then create a new variable\n\\[\n\\tilde{y} = y - \\theta x,\n\\]\nwhere – it turns out – the optimal choice for \\(\\theta\\) is \\(\\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)}\\), which we can easily calculate from the available data.\nThis is useful because it can be shown that if we now evaluate our experiment using \\(\\tilde{y}\\) instead of \\(y\\), the treatment estimate will be the same but it’s standard error will be lower, which will increase power. The standard error of the treatment effect estimate is lower because the variance of \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is lower than that of \\(y\\) whenever \\(cov(y, x) \\neq 0\\), that is, whenever \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are indeed correlated. To be precise, we have:\n\\[\nvar(\\tilde{y}) = var(y)(1 - \\rho^2),\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\rho\\) is the Pearson correlation between \\(x\\) and \\(y\\):\n\\[\n\\rho = \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)var(y)}.\n\\]\nPresentation notes:\n\nAssume that in addition to our outcome variable \\(Y\\), we have access to another random variable, \\(X\\), which is independent of the treatment assignment and has known expectation \\(\\mathbb{E}X\\).\nWe can then define \\(\\bar{Y}^{cuped} = \\bar{Y} - \\theta \\bar{X} + \\theta \\mathbb{E}X\\) for both treatment and control groups, and compare avearge outcomes in this adjusted metric.\nOur new estimator is: \\(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped} = \\bar{Y}^{cuped}_t - \\bar{Y}^{cuped}_c\\).\n\\(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\) is unbiased since \\(\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\right] = \\bar{Y}_t - \\bar{Y}_c = \\tau\\) (proof in appendix below).\nIf treatment effects are small (which, in practice, they usually are) and for an optimal choice of \\(\\theta\\): \\(\\mathbb{V}\\left(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\right) \\simeq \\left(\\frac{s_t}{N_t} + \\frac{s_c}{N_c}\\right)\\left(1 - \\rho^2\\right)\\), where \\(\\rho\\) is the correlation coefficient of \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\).\nHence: \\(\\frac{\\mathbb{V}(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped})}{\\mathbb{V}(\\hat{\\tau}^{dif})} = 1 - \\rho^2\\) – the higher the correlation between \\(Y\\) and \\(X\\), the more CUPED reduces the variance of our treatment estimate.\n\n\\(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\) is unbiased:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\right] &= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_t - \\bar{Y}^{cuped}_c\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t + \\theta \\mathbb{E}X\\right) - \\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c + \\theta \\mathbb{E}X\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t\\right) - \\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c\\right)\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\bar{Y}_t - \\bar{Y}_c\\right] \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\frac{1}{N_t}\\sum_{\\text{i:T=1}}Y_i- \\frac{1}{N_c}\\sum_{\\text{i:T=0}}Y_i\\right] \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{N_t} N_t \\mathbb{E}Y_t - \\frac{1}{N_c} N_c \\mathbb{E}Y_c \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{E}Y_t - \\mathbb{E}Y_c \\\\\n&= \\bar{Y}_t - \\bar{Y}_c \\\\\n&= \\tau\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\\(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\) has variance:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\mathbb{V}\\left(\\hat{\\tau}^{cuped}\\right) &= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_t - \\bar{Y}^{cuped}_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_t\\right) + \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}^{cuped}_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t + \\theta \\mathbb{E}X\\right) + \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c + \\theta\n\\mathbb{E}X\\right) \\\\\n&= \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_t - \\theta \\bar{X}_t\\right) + \\mathbb{V}\\left(\\bar{Y}_c - \\theta \\bar{X}_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{N_t}\\mathbb{V}\\left(Y_t - \\theta X_t\\right) + \\frac{1}{N_c}\\mathbb{V}\\left(Y_c - \\theta X_c\\right) \\\\\n&= \\frac{1}{N_t}\\left[\\mathbb{V}(Y_t) + \\theta^2 \\mathbb{V}(X_t) - 2\\theta Cov(Y_t, X_t)\\right] + \\frac{1}{N_c}\\left[\\mathbb{V}(Y_c) + \\theta^2 \\mathbb{V}(X_c) - 2\\theta Cov(Y_c, X_c)\\right]\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThis is minimised for:\n\\[\n\\theta^* = \\frac{Cov(Y_t, X_t) + Cov(Y_c, X_c)}{\\mathbb{V}(X_t) + \\mathbb{V}(X_c)}\n\\]\nIn practice, a common approach is to pool the data to get:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\theta^*_p &= \\frac{Cov(Y, X) + Cov(Y, X)}{\\mathbb{V}(X) + \\mathbb{V}(X)}\\\\\n&= \\frac{Cov(Y, X)}{\\mathbb{V}(X)},\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nand to assume that \\(\\mathbb{V}(X_t) \\simeq \\mathbb{V}(X_t)\\), and \\(Cov(Y_t, X_t) \\simeq Cov(Y_c, X_c)\\), which is reasonable as long as the treatment effect is not too large (see discussion towards the end here).

That is, the two models are identical.\nSecond, to obtain \\(\\tilde{y}\\), we first estimate\n\\[\ny = \\alpha + \\delta x_i + u_i,\n\\]\nand then calculate \\(\\tilde{y} = y - \\delta x\\) (the calculation of \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\) works analogously). Given that this is a simple regression model, we know that \\(\\delta = \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)}\\) so that\n\\[\n\\tilde{y} = y - \\frac{cov(y, x)}{var(x)}x.\n\\]\nFinally, above in our discussion of CUPED we have seen that the CUPED-adjusted outcome metric \\(\\tilde{y}\\) is defined in exactly the same way. Hence, to evaluate an experiment with a CUPED-adjusted outcome, we would estimate the model:\n\\[\n\\tilde{y}_i = \\alpha + \\beta^* d_i + \\epsilon_i^*,\n\\]\nNotice that the only difference to model (2) is that we don’t adjust the treatment assignment – we use \\(d_i\\) instead of \\(\\tilde{d}_i\\). But if the treatment assignment is random, then \\(cov(d, x) = 0\\) so that the adjustment has no effect and we have \\(\\tilde{d}_i = d_i\\). Hence, the two approaches are the same.\nIn general, regression adjustment and CUPED are identical if two conditions hold: (1) the treatment indicator is independent of \\(x\\), and (2) we use a linear CUPED adjustment. In the context of experimentation, where treatment is random, and with the classical (linear) CUPED adjustment discussed above, this is always the case.\nThe reason why in practice we get a don’t get the exact same result is that the covariance of \\(d\\) and \\(x\\) is only approximately 0, hence providing very similar, but not identical results.\n\n\n5.5.4 Is CUPED DiD?\n\nIs CUPED DiD?

    "text": "5.6 Blog post notes\nCUPED is a re-invention of multiple linear regression. Evan Miller (here) and Matteo Courthoud (here) make similar points in their excellent posts on the topic, but – given my starting point – neither quite helped me fully understand what is going on. This post is my attempt to do that.\nIn particular, I think that to really understand the connection between multiple linear regression and CUPED, you have to understand the linear algebra of the Frisch-Waugh-Lowell theorem (FWL) rather than just knowing that that theorem says, and to understand that, you have to understand the concept of a projection.\n\nThe motivation for CUPED seems to be a bit of a strawman: that regression adjustment relies on assumption that expectation of Y conditional on X is linear. Imbens and Rubin in 7.5 show that this is not required. Neither is homoskedasticity, or, rather, this should hold anyways given randomisation.

We can calculate P-values by calculating the test statistic for all possible assignments, and then calculate the probability that the test-statistic is as extreme or more extreme than the value of the test statistic we observe given the actual assignment.\n[^hypothesis] Compare this to the null hypothesis we more frequently test in experiments, namely, that there is no treatment effect on average. This later hypothesis is less strict (or sharp) than Fisher’s, but arguably of more practical interest most of the time."
