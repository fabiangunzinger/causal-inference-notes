# Regression discontinuity design

## Use cases
- Identifiable forcing variable

## Considerations
- Functional form: use local linear methods
- Choice of bandwidth: use asymptotic expansion
- Assessing  (internal) validity: use suplementary analysis
- Assessing external validity: assess credibility of extrapolation to other subpopulations
