# todo


- [ ] Complete reboot of mac (if works well after, keep, else buy new macbook)
- [ ] Get internal preview to work

- [ ] Collect all relevant theory in `experiment_theory.md`
  - [ ] Integrate imbens2015causal
  - [ ] Integrate athey2017econometrics
  - [ ] Integrate aronow2013class as relevant
  - [ ] Integrate abadie2020sampling as relevant

- [ ] Unbiasedness and variance of diff-in-means estimator for online experiments based on full theory. The relevant framework for derivations of unbiasedness and variance of diff-in-means estimator for online experiment is BRE, which is not straightforward. So I first do CRE, and then adapt. 
    - [ ] CRE finite sample case
    - [ ] CRE super-population case
    - [ ] BRE finite sample case
    - [ ] BRE super-population case
    - [ ] Use the derivations for book, but also think about paper (check with Max for relevant outlet if needed)

- [ ] Add section on testing and CI

- [ ] Add section on power calculations
    - [ ] Incorporate all metrics types to power calculation (see hesterberg2024power)
    - [ ] Differentiate between relative and abs MDES (default is abs)
    - [ ] Derive power formula
        - [x] From first princples
        - [ ] Starting from alpha and beta
        - [ ] Visual Bloom approach
    - Derive shortcut formulas
        - [ ] Section on 16 vs 32 confusion
    - [ ] Clean up rest of chapter
    - [ ] Power for different metric types (define continuous, proportion, ratio, etc. metrics -- how do they affect calculations?)
    - [ ] Build power calculator (check Statsig one â€” but add unbalanced samples option), build beautiful visualisations (use uv for package mgt)


Later:

- [ ] Read and integrate seminal Rubin papers

- Integrate Kohavi advanced topics into book: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12iy35z_aM5r76gqgq5f-mzVRwZoHjz4kBjv3rMULSEw/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.3qu16rq6g769 
- Integrate alternative experiment designs from Matheus Facure: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cyRKkxvOAosMzlIVnSIGfZf63nq7PwZ9zaL5NZEn19c/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g1e5c694a008_0_52, and discussion here: https://www.linkedin.com/posts/matheus-facure-7b0099117_alternative-experiment-designs-activity-7247577102797938688-s31_?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop

- Integrate pervasive experimentation problems: https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2024/06/20/pervasive-randomization-problems-here-with-headline-experiments/

- [ ] Add discussion on model vs randomisation based inference
- [ ] Bayesian experimentation
- [ ] Regression
- [ ] Regression approach to experiments
    - [ ] Friedman critique
    - [ ] Lin response
    - [ ] Imbens and Rubin approach
- [ ] CUPED
    - [ ] Connection to DiD


- [ ] Power of random experiments (post 2)

- [ ] Variance reduction notes from JET project

- [ ] CUPED vs regression adjustment discussion 
    - [ ] Friedman critique of OLS and Lin response (and Imbens and Rubin take)
    - [ ] My notes on regression adjustment ignore demeaning (y tilde is alpha hat plut betahat times x, so not exactly the same as cuped, but has no effect because alpha is demeaning only and has no effect on cov and var. Write down)
    - [ ] Individual-level adjustment vs group adjustment (-x_i vs -\bar{x}) See Bookings post on this.
    - [ ] CUPED in practice: all the important decisions you have to make nobody talks about.


- [ ] FDR vs family-wise-false-positive rate

- [ ] Always-valid p-values

- [ ] Add visualisations
    - [ ] Find suitable library (tikz? 3b1b?)

- [ ] Why is qe power lower than experiment power? must be due to higher sampling variance. how come?

- [ ] Incorporate relevant stuff from Spotify posts: https://engineering.atspotify.com/tag/experimentation/

- [ ] Read Imbens and Athey papers

- imbens2020potential - up to section 2.4

- athey2019machine

- Marton Trencseni posts on a/b testing (https://bytepawn.com/tag/ab-testing.html)

- Lukas Vermeer posts (https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/)

- [ ] Gelman et al chapters

- [ ] Quasi-experimental methods - Angrist and Pischke book

- [ ] Cox and Reid book (https://www.amazon.co.uk/Experiments-Chapman-Monographs-Statistics-Probability-ebook/dp/B00UVA67EC/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1673947989&sr=8-1)

- [ ] Business data science (https://www.lukasvermeer.nl/publications/)
Stuff to consider

- ML and causal inference Mixtape course

- Machine learning and econometrics (Athey and Imbens lectures - https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2018-webcasts)

- [ ] bojinov2023design section 5 for cool approach to experiment simulation that I might want to add to rosalie.
