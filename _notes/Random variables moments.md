In general, the kth uncentered moment of a discrete random variable X is defined by

$$
E(X^k) = \sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)x_i^k,
$$

and the kth centered moment as

$$
E\left(X-E(X)\right)^k = \sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)(x_i - \mu)^k,
$$

  Hence, the mean of a random variable is the first uncentered momement, and the variance is the second centered moment.
