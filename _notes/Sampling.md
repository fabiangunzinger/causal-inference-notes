[[_Experimentation]]

- We rely on a sample to learn about a larger population.

- We thus need to make sure that the sampling procedure is free of bias, so that units in the sample are representative of those in the population.

- While representativeness cannot be achieved perfectly, it's important to ensure that non-representativeness is due to random error and not due to systematic bias.

- Random errors produce deviations that vary over repeated samples, while systematic bias persists. Such selection bias can lead to misleading and ephemeral conclusions.

- Sampling procedures:
	- [[Simple random sampling]]
	- [[Completely random sampling]]
	- [[Stratified random sampling]]

- The mean outcome of the sample is denoted $\bar{x}$; that of the population, $\mu$.

- Repeated sampling creates a [[Sampling distribution]]
