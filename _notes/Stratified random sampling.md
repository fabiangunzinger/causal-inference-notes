- Randomly select $n_s$ from each stratum $S$ of a population of $N$

- On stratification: why does it reduce variance? Imagine an extreme case, where the number of strata were equal to the number of different units in the sample. In this case, the variance would be zero. Number of diff units here needs be individuals, but groups of units that share all relevant characteristics
